\chapter{Introduction}
Artificial inteligence is a science field which aims to build intelligententities
and understand the principles behind it \cite{AIMA_book}.




Machine learning is without a doubt one of the leading science fields, and its 
results are getting an interest outside the academic world. Intelligent solutions
using AI are taking a place in today's society. From virtual voice assistants, 
translators to autonomus cars. It is not only influecing our daily lives,
but the another science fields as well. Machine learning can be helpfull
tool practicaly everywhere, where are data. 

Human's percetiom of the world commes from multiple senses. In case of machines,
this connection needs to be created by engeneering. BUt raw images are meaningless
to a computer. To process such input.

\chapter{Convolutional neural net}
Convolutional neural nets are a family of neural nets, which use a convolutional layer.
Usually they take as an input grid structured data \cite{DL_BOOK}, typicaly images, for example
 one may see as 3D tensor, one dimension for each primary color in RGB encoding. But from their
 first pracical use in reading check system \cite{CHECKS}, they have been applied in many 
 domains, not only necessarily image processing. They have been used in text processing, for
 example in anlayzing sentiment of a text \cite{SENTIMENT_CNN}, time series classification 
\cite{TS_CNN} or in the field of recommender systems \cite{REC_CNN}. Its main component is a
convolutional layer, which is often combinied a pooling layer. One may find convolutional 
networks combined with fully-connected or even LSTM layers \cite{LSTM_CNN}.


\section{Convolutional layer}
The cornerstone of each convolutional neural net is a convolutional layer. In this layer, 
one or multiple convolutional filters are applied on the layer's input. 

\section{Pooling layer}

\subsection{Average-pooling}


\subsection{Max-pooling}


\section{Fully-connected layer}


\section{Training}

\chapter{Implementation details}
The project was implemented in programing language Python \cite{Python}, version 3.7.
For using, creating and training neural network is used deep learning library PyTorch\cite{PyTorch}.
Code documentation is following numpy docstring guide, and it is formatted by Black code 
formater \cite{Black}


\section{Project structure}
The project is divided into three main parts: classification, localization and segmentation.
Code share between them is stored in the root directory. For each part there files which create
models, datasets and may contain some additional funcionality, for example data data augmentation.
The complete structure can be seen on figure TODO.

\section{Examples}
For every part there is an example script which traines sample model on specified dataset. For
every type of model there is a script with example usage as well as samle data on which these 
models can be ran. All of the examples scripts can be found the the root directory.
