# Cartroids

Carotis were created as a software-research semester project at the Faculty
of Electrical engineering at CTU in Prague. In this work we explore dataset
of ultrasound carotid images. The project itself is divided into three main 
parts:

* Categorization
* Localization
* Segmentation
  
For each of these segments one can find the codebase defines in particularly named sub-folder and running script in the folder carotids. The reports to each of this tasks are located in the folder reports.

### Implementation details
The work is implemented primarily in Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.6.

### Implementation details
Created by Martin Kostelansky in the year 2020.
